# Core dependencies for the rowing timer application
# Most functionality uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework, included with Python)
# - json (data persistence)
# - os (file operations)
# - time (timing functionality)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - csv (CSV export functionality)

# Required for PDF export functionality:
reportlab>=3.5.0     # PDF generation and formatting

# Required for building executable:
pyinstaller>=5.0.0   # Create standalone executable files

# Platform-specific notes:
# Windows: All dependencies install via pip
# Linux: May need system packages:
#   - sudo apt install python3-tk (for tkinter on Ubuntu/Mint)
#   - sudo dnf install python3-tkinter (for tkinter on Fedora)

# Optional enhancements you might consider:
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For plotting time graphs
# pandas>=1.3.0      # For advanced data analysis
# openpyxl>=3.0.0    # For Excel export functionality
