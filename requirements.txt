# No external dependencies required
# The rowing timer application uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework, included with Python)
# - json (data persistence)
# - os (file operations)
# - time (timing functionality)
# - datetime (timestamps)

# If you want to enhance the application with additional features, you might consider:
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For plotting time graphs
# pandas>=1.3.0      # For advanced data analysis
# openpyxl>=3.0.0    # For Excel export functionality
